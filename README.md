# Spotify-Greeting-Card

Interactive web based greeting card for you to send to your friends and family. Built from an idea I had of wanting to be able to share songs I vibe to with my friends based on their moods (hence the emojis). At its core the programme just provides an interface and framework for communicating with the Spotify API. Feel free to remix the programme for whatever idea you may have.


# How To Use:
Customise your own message, and add one or more spotify playlists of your choosing. A song from the playlist is randomly picked on each API request and it is presented with a dynamic background based on the song's album art alongside a link to open the song in spotify.

1. Editable areas are easily found by looking for the __φ(．．) 
2. You will need a client id and client secret which can both be obtained by starting a project on https://developer.spotify.com/. Place it in script.js
3. Obtain the playlist ID from your desired playlist and place it in script.js
4. Csutomise your own message in index.html
5. Deploy as a static site through your preferred web hosting service
